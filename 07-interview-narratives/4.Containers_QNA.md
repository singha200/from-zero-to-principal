---

## **🚀 Beginner-Level Docker & Kubernetes Questions (1-20)**  

### **Docker Basics**  

### **1. What is Docker, and why is it used?**  

**Answer:**  
Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies into a single unit called a **container**.  

- **Why use Docker?**  
  ✅ Ensures **consistent environments** across different machines.  
  ✅ **Lightweight & faster** than virtual machines.  
  ✅ **Easy scaling** of applications in microservices architectures.  

---

### **2. What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine (VM)?**  

**Answer:**  

| Feature | Docker | Virtual Machine |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Isolation** | Uses **containers** to isolate apps | Uses **hypervisor** to run separate OS instances |
| **Performance** | **Faster, lightweight** | **Slower, resource-intensive** |
| **Startup Time** | **Milliseconds** | **Minutes** |
| **Use Case** | Ideal for **microservices** | Best for **full OS emulation** |

---

### **3. What is a Docker image?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Docker image** is a **read-only template** containing everything needed to run an application, including:  

- Source code  
- Libraries & dependencies  
- Configuration files  

A container is created from a **Docker image** using the `docker run` command.  

---

### **4. What is a Docker container?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Docker container** is a **running instance of a Docker image**. It is:  
✅ **Lightweight** (shares OS kernel)  
✅ **Isolated** (has its own filesystem, network, and process space)  
✅ **Portable** (can run on any system with Docker installed)  

---

### **5. How do you create and run a Docker container?**  

**Answer:**  
To run a container from an image:  

```sh
docker run -d --name myapp nginx
```

- `-d`: Run in **detached mode** (background).  
- `--name myapp`: Name the container `myapp`.  
- `nginx`: Use the **nginx image**.  

---

### **6. What is the purpose of the Dockerfile?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Dockerfile** is a script that contains **instructions to build a Docker image**.  
Example `Dockerfile`:  

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

- `FROM`: Base image.  
- `WORKDIR`: Set working directory.  
- `COPY`: Copy files.  
- `RUN`: Execute commands (install dependencies).  
- `CMD`: Define the default command to run.  

---

### **7. What are Docker volumes?**  

**Answer:**  
Docker **volumes** store persistent data outside a container's filesystem.  

- **Types:**  
  - **Anonymous Volumes**: `docker run -v /data nginx`  
  - **Named Volumes**: `docker volume create mydata`  
  - **Bind Mounts**: `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx`  

---

### **8. How do you list running Docker containers?**  

**Answer:**  
Use the command:  

```sh
docker ps
```

To list **all containers** (including stopped ones):  

```sh
docker ps -a
```

---

### **9. What is Docker Compose?**  

**Answer:**  
Docker Compose is a tool for **defining and running multi-container applications**.  

- Example `docker-compose.yml`:  

  ```yaml
  version: "3"
  services:
    web:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
    db:
      image: mysql
      environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  ```

- Start with: `docker-compose up -d`  
- Stop with: `docker-compose down`  

---

### **10. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker?**  

**Answer:**  

| Feature | CMD | ENTRYPOINT |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Default command | Fixed executable command |
| **Overridable?** | Yes | No (unless `--entrypoint` is used) |
| **Example** | `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` | `ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]` |

### **11. Docker container exits immediately after running a command. How can you troubleshoot?**
**Answer:**  
- Check the container logs: `docker logs <container_id>`  
- Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to view container details.
- Ensure the command in the Dockerfile or `docker run` is correct and does not exit prematurely.  
- If using `CMD`, consider using `ENTRYPOINT` for long-running processes.

### **12. what is the purpose of EXPOSE in Dockerfile?**
**Answer:**  
The `EXPOSE` instruction in a Dockerfile is used to indicate which ports the container will listen on at runtime. It serves as documentation and does not actually publish the port. To publish the port, you need to use the `-p` option with `docker run`.

### **13. port is not accessible on localhost after running a Docker container. How can you troubleshoot?**
**Answer:**  
- Ensure you are using the `-p` option to map the container port to the host port: `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx`  
- Check if the container is running: `docker ps`  
- Verify that the application inside the container is listening on the correct port.  
- Check firewall settings on the host machine that may block access to the port.

### **14. Data lost when a Docker container is stopped. How can you persist data?**  
**Answer:**  
- Use **Docker volumes** to persist data outside the container's filesystem.  
- Example: `docker run -v mydata:/data nginx`  
- Use **bind mounts** to link a host directory to a container directory: `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx`  
- Ensure the application inside the container writes data to the mounted volume or bind mount.

### **15. you made change in your code, rebuilt the image but the changes are not reflected in the running container. How can you resolve this?**
**Answer:**  
- Ensure you rebuild the image with the `docker build` command.  
- Use the `--no-cache` option to avoid using cached layers: `docker build --no-cache -t myapp .`  
- Restart the container with the new image: `docker run -d --name myapp myapp:latest`  
- If using Docker Compose, run `docker-compose up -d --build` to rebuild and restart the service with the latest changes.

### **16. App crashes with "permission denied" in container but works on host. How can you resolve this?**
**Answer:**  
- Ensure the user running the application inside the container has the necessary permissions to access files or directories.  
- Use the `USER` instruction in the Dockerfile to run the application as a non-root user with appropriate permissions.  
- If using bind mounts, ensure the host directory has the correct permissions for the user inside the container.  
- You can also use `chmod` or `chown` commands to adjust permissions on the host directory before running the container.

### **17. Docker host is running out of disk space after running multiple containers. How can you free up space?**
**Answer:**  
- Remove unused containers: `docker container prune`  
- Remove unused images: `docker image prune -a`  
- Remove unused volumes: `docker volume prune`  
- Use `docker system prune` to remove all unused data (containers, images, networks, and build cache).  
- Regularly clean up old images and containers to prevent disk space issues.

### **18. How will you debug a live Docker container?**
**Answer:**  
- Use `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh` to access the container's shell for debugging.  
- Check logs with `docker logs <container_id>`.  
- Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to view container details and configuration.  
- Use `docker top <container_id>` to see running processes inside the container.

### **19. which container registry you are using in your organization?**
**Answer:**  
- We use **Docker Hub** for public images and **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** for private images.  
- We also use **GitHub Container Registry** for CI/CD workflows and **Google Container Registry** for GCP deployments.  
- For sensitive applications, we use **Harbor** as a private container registry to manage and secure our images.
- we use quay.io for openshift deployments.

### **20. What is the difference between Entrypoint and CMD in Docker?**
**Answer:**
**ENTRYPOINT** is used to define the main command that will always run when the container starts, while **CMD** provides default arguments to that command. If both are specified, CMD arguments will override the ENTRYPOINT arguments.  
- **ENTRYPOINT** is not overridden by command-line arguments, while **CMD** can be overridden.  
- Best practice: Use **ENTRYPOINT** for the main application command and **CMD** for default arguments.

### **21. What are the best practices for writing Dockerfiles?**
**Answer:**
- Use a **minimal base image** (e.g., `alpine` or `scratch`) to reduce image size.  
- Combine multiple `RUN` commands into one to minimize layers.  
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.  
- Use **multi-stage builds** to keep the final image small.  
- Specify a **non-root user** to run the application for security.  
- Use **explicit version tags** for base images to ensure consistency.
- Keep the Dockerfile **simple and readable** by using comments and clear instructions.

### **22. How do you handle secrets in Docker?**
**Answer:**
- Use **Docker secrets** for sensitive data in Swarm mode:
```sh
docker secret create my_secret my_secret_file
```
- Use environment variables for non-sensitive data:
```sh
docker run -e MY_ENV_VAR=value myapp
```
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles or images.
- Use external secret management tools like **HashiCorp Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**
- Use **Docker Compose** to define secrets:
```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp  
    secrets:
      - my_secret
secrets:
  my_secret:
    file: ./my_secret_file
```
### **23. What docker commands do you use daily?**
**Answer:**
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker images`: List available images.
- `docker run`: Start a new container.
- `docker exec`: Execute commands inside a running container.
- `docker logs`: View logs of a container.
- `docker build`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker-compose up`: Start services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker network ls`: List Docker networks.    
- `docker volume ls`: List Docker volumes.
- `docker system df`: Check disk usage by Docker objects.
- `docker inspect`: Get detailed information about a container or image.

### **24. when will you forcefully remove a docker container?**
**Answer:**
- When a container is stuck in a **"running"** state and not responding to normal stop commands.
- When a container is consuming excessive resources and needs to be terminated immediately.
- When a container is in a **"dead"** state and cannot be restarted.
- When you need to quickly clean up resources during development or testing.
- Use the command: `docker rm -f <container_id>` to forcefully remove a container.

## **Kubernetes Basics**  

### **11. What is Kubernetes and explain its architecture?**  

**Answer:**  
Kubernetes (K8s) is an **orchestration platform** for managing containerized applications.  

- **Features:**  
  ✅ **Automated scaling**  
  ✅ **Self-healing** (restarts failed containers)  
  ✅ **Load balancing**  
  ✅ **Rolling updates**  
- **Architecture Components:**  
   - divided in control plane and data plane
  - **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster, including scheduling and maintaining the desired state. Controls the cluster, manages API server, scheduler, and controller manager.  
  - **Data Plane**: Runs the applications in Pods. Components like Nodes, Kubelet, and Kube-proxy. 
  - **Nodes**: Machines (physical or virtual) that run the Pods.  
  - **Components**:  
  - **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for cluster state. All cluster data is stored here. you can consider it as a database for kubernetes cluster. 
  - **Kube-apiserver**: API server for communication. Every request to the cluster goes through this. 
  - **Kube-controller-manager**: Manages controllers for different resources. Like replicaset controller, node controller, etc.  
  - **Kube-scheduler**: Assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource availability and policies like affinity and anti-affinity. 
  - **Kubelet**: Agent that runs on each Node, ensuring Pods are running, invoke the container run time to run the pod on worker node.  
  - **Kube-proxy**: Manages network routing to Pods. when service is created, kube-proxy creates iptables rules to route traffic to the correct pod.service->kube proxy->iptables rules->pod. 

---

### **12. What is a Kubernetes Pod?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Pod** is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. It **groups one or more containers** that share the same network and storage.  

---

### **13. What is a Kubernetes Deployment and how various componenets of kubernetes interact when you run kubectl apply(pod)?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Deployment** manages Pod creation and updates.  
Example YAML:  

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx
```

- `replicas: 3` → Runs **3 instances**.  
- `matchLabels` → Ensures the correct Pods are managed.  

when you run `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`, the following happens:
- When you run kubectl apply, it sends an HTTPS request to the Kubernetes API server with your Pod spec.
The API server stores it in etcd, and the scheduler assigns it to a node.
Kubelet on that node watches the API server, pulls the image, and starts the Pod.
Networking is set up via CNI, enabling Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-Service communication.
- kubectl → API Server → etcd  
            ↓  
        Scheduler ← watches  
            ↓  
        API Server → Kubelet (on node) → Container Runtime (pull image) → CNI Plugin → Pod (running)
---

### **14. What is a Kubernetes Service?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Service** exposes a set of Pods over a network. By default follows round robin load balancing. Service uses a label and **selector** to identify Pods and dns to resolve the service name to the IP address of the Pods. 

- **Types:**  
  - **ClusterIP** (default) will expose the service on a cluster-internal IP.so that it can be accessed only within the cluster by other pods. 
  - **NodePort** (exposes on a fixed port) will expose the service on each Node's IP at a static port. This allows external traffic to access the service via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.  
  - **LoadBalancer** (uses cloud provider's load balancer) will create an external load balancer that routes traffic to the service.
  - **ExternalName** (maps to an external DNS name) will map the service to an external DNS name.  
  - **Headless Service** (no ClusterIP) allows direct access to Pods without load balancing. used for stateful applications like databases. 

Example YAML:  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007
```

---

### **15. What is the purpose of Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets?**  

**Answer:**  

- **ConfigMaps** store non-sensitive configuration data.  
- **Secrets** store **sensitive** data (passwords, API keys).  

Example Secret:  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  password: bXlwYXNzd29yZA==
```

---

### **16. What is a Kubernetes Namespace?**  

**Answer:**  
Namespaces **logically separate resources** within a cluster.  

```sh
kubectl create namespace dev
kubectl get namespaces
```

---

### **17. What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  
A **StatefulSet** is used for **stateful applications** like databases. Unlike Deployments, it maintains:  
✅ **Stable pod identity**  
✅ **Persistent storage**  

---

### **18. How do you scale a Deployment in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  
Manually scale using:  

```sh
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
```

---

### **19. What is a DaemonSet?**  

**Answer:**  
A **DaemonSet** ensures that **one Pod runs on every node** (e.g., logging agents, monitoring).  

---

### **20. How do you update a Kubernetes Deployment?**  

**Answer:**  
Update the image and apply changes:  

```sh
kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-container=nginx:latest
```

---

### **21. Why is hardcoding pod ip in application code not recommended?**
**Answer:**
Hardcoding Pod IPs is not recommended because:
- **Dynamic IPs**: Pod IPs can change when Pods are restarted or rescheduled.
- **Scaling Issues**: As the number of Pods increases, hardcoded IPs become unmanageable.
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes provides services for dynamic discovery, allowing Pods to communicate without relying on fixed IPs.
- **Load Balancing**: Services can distribute traffic across multiple Pods, which is not possible with hardcoded IPs.

---

### **33. How do you check logs of a running Pod in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  

```sh
kubectl logs my-pod
kubectl logs -f my-pod  # Stream logs in real-time
```

---

### **34. What are Kubernetes Labels and Selectors?**  

**Answer:**  
### Short explanation of the question  
This question evaluates your understanding of how Kubernetes identifies and groups objects like pods, services, or deployments using metadata. It's fundamental to pod selection, service discovery, and workload management.

---

### Answer  
**Labels** are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects for identification, while **selectors** are used to filter or group objects based on their labels. Services, ReplicaSets, and deployments use selectors to manage the right set of pods.

---

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

---

## 🏷️ What are Labels?

Labels are **metadata** assigned to Kubernetes objects such as pods, nodes, services, etc.

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: frontend
    env: production
```

These labels help Kubernetes components **identify, select, or group** resources dynamically.

---

## 🔍 What are Selectors?

Selectors are **queries** used by other resources to match specific labels. For example, a service can use a selector to send traffic only to pods with a particular label.

```yaml
selector:
  app: frontend
```

---

### 🧪 Example: Pod + Service using Labels and Selectors

**Pod:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend-pod
  labels:
    app: frontend
    tier: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

**Service:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - port: 80
```

- The service will automatically **discover and route traffic** to all pods with label `app: frontend`.

---

### 🎯 Why Labels & Selectors Are Useful

| Use Case                        | How Labels Help |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Service-to-Pod communication     | Services use selectors to match pods |
| Rolling updates & scaling        | Deployments use label selectors |
| Monitoring & grouping metrics    | Tools like Prometheus use labels |
| Cost allocation or chargeback    | Labels can represent teams, owners, or projects |
| Node affinity & scheduling       | Pods match labels on nodes |

---

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “We used labels like `team: payments` and `env: staging` to filter out specific pods in monitoring dashboards and CI pipelines. Our deployment strategy relied heavily on matching these labels for safe rollouts.”

---

### Summary

| Concept     | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Label       | Metadata to tag objects |
| Selector    | Query to match label values and group resources |

---

### Key takeaway

> "Labels describe objects; selectors find and group them. Together, they enable dynamic, flexible, and scalable Kubernetes management."

---

### **35. What is a Kubernetes Ingress?**  

**Answer:**  
An **Ingress** manages external access to services.  
Example:  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Use **Ingress controllers (NGINX, Traefik)** to manage Ingress resources.

---

### **36. What is the difference between Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)?**  

**Answer:**  

| Feature | HPA | VPA |
|---------|----|----|
| **Scaling Type** | Adds/removes pods | Adjusts CPU/memory of existing pods |
| **Use Case** | High traffic apps | Resource optimization |

Example of **HPA**:  

```sh
kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --cpu-percent=50 --min=2 --max=10
```

---

### **37. What is a Kubernetes Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)?**  

**Answer:**  
A **Persistent Volume (PV)** is a storage resource, and a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** requests storage.  
Example:  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

---

### **38. How do you upgrade a running application in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  
Modify the image and apply the deployment:  

```sh
kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-container=nginx:1.20
kubectl rollout status deployment my-app
```

---

### **39. What is a Kubernetes Job and CronJob?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Job**: Runs **once** and exits.  
- **CronJob**: Runs **on a schedule** (like a Linux cron).  

Example:  

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: my-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox
              command: ["echo", "Hello from Kubernetes"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

---

### **40. How do you debug Kubernetes pods that are stuck in "CrashLoopBackOff"?**  

**Answer:**  

1. **Check pod logs:**  

   ```sh
   kubectl logs my-pod
   ```

2. **Describe the pod for errors:**  

   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod my-pod
   ```

3. **Exec into the container:**

---

### **60. What is Kubernetes Cluster Federation?**  

**Answer:**  

- Manages **multiple clusters** as a **single entity**.  
- Benefits: **Cross-region high availability, policy consistency**.  
- Example tool: `kubefed`  

---

### Question 61 When exposing an application outside a Kubernetes cluster, would you choose a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service? Justify your recommendation.

### Answer  
**I would recommend using a LoadBalancer service** over NodePort for production environments, especially in cloud-based clusters. It provides a managed, scalable, and reliable way to expose services externally.

---

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

Let’s compare both options:

---

### 📦 NodePort Service

- Exposes a service on a static port (30000–32767) on **every node** in the cluster.
- You access the app via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
- Suitable for **development**, testing, or when used behind an external load balancer.

```yaml
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

❌ **Cons:**
- Manual external load balancing or DNS management.
- Port range limitation.
- No TLS termination or advanced routing.

---

### ☁️ LoadBalancer Service

- Provisions a **cloud provider-managed external load balancer** (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure LB).
- Automatically routes traffic to backend pods.
- Easier to set up and **production-grade**.

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
```

✅ **Pros:**
- Public IP automatically assigned.
- Built-in cloud integrations.
- Scales with the app.
- Easier TLS, health checks, etc.

---

### 🔍 Example Use Case

| Use Case                  | Recommended |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Local testing on Minikube | NodePort    |
| Dev/staging in the cloud  | NodePort (sometimes) |
| Production in the cloud   | LoadBalancer ✅ |

---

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In our AWS cluster, we use LoadBalancer type services to expose APIs. It automatically attaches an ELB and handles routing. For local Docker Desktop clusters, we sometimes use NodePort for quick testing.”

---

### Key takeaway

> "NodePort is fine for quick access in development, but for scalable, secure, and reliable access in cloud environments — always go with LoadBalancer."




### 62 Question What are the limitations or disadvantages of using the `LoadBalancer` service type in Kubernetes?

### Answer  
The main disadvantages of LoadBalancer service type are:  
- **Cost** (provisioning a load balancer per service)  
- **Scalability limitations** (1:1 mapping between service and LB)  
- **Vendor lock-in** (cloud-specific implementation)  
- **Lack of advanced routing** (unlike Ingress controllers)


### ☁️ LoadBalancer: Quick Recap

When you define a service with type `LoadBalancer`, Kubernetes asks the underlying cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to provision a **cloud-native Layer 4 load balancer** (e.g., AWS ELB).

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
```

The LB automatically routes traffic to the backend pods via the cluster’s nodes.

---

### 🚨 Key Disadvantages

#### 💰 1. Cost Overhead
- Each service of type `LoadBalancer` results in a separate cloud load balancer.
- In AWS, this means multiple ELBs — which cost money even when idle.
  
> “We had 10 microservices each with LoadBalancer — leading to unneeded monthly costs.”

---

#### 🧱 2. Scalability and Management
- You cannot reuse the same load balancer for multiple services.
- Managing dozens of LoadBalancer services becomes hard and messy.

---

#### 🛠 3. Vendor Lock-In
- Only works in cloud providers that support managed LBs.
- Doesn’t work on bare-metal or local environments without external LB integrations (like MetalLB).

---

#### 🚦 4. No L7 (HTTP) Routing
- It only routes at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), no path-based or host-based routing.
- You can’t split `/api` vs `/web` without using Ingress.

---

### 🔁 Alternative Approach

For more flexibility:
- Use **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB Ingress)
- One LB + multiple services
- Better routing, SSL termination, cost efficiency

---

### 📊 Summary Comparison

| Feature                | LoadBalancer      | Ingress           |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cost per service       | High (1 LB each)  | Low (1 LB shared) |
| HTTP routing support   | ❌                | ✅                |
| External IP assigned   | ✅                | ✅                |
| Works locally          | ❌ (cloud only)   | ✅ (via NGINX etc.) |

---

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In our production setup, we used a LoadBalancer for the Ingress Controller only — not for individual services. That gave us cost control and L7 routing.”

---

### Key takeaway

> "LoadBalancer is easy and direct but becomes expensive and rigid as your services grow. It’s great for simple setups, but for scalable production environments — pair it with Ingress."



### Question 63  What is a headless service in Kubernetes and in what scenarios have you used it?

### Answer  A **Headless Service** in Kubernetes is a service with **no ClusterIP**, meaning Kubernetes does not load balance traffic. Instead, DNS returns **the individual pod IPs**. I’ve used it for StatefulSets like **MySQL clusters** or **Kafka brokers**, where each pod needs to be accessed directly.

A headless service is defined with:

```yaml
spec:
  clusterIP: None
```

This disables the default Kubernetes load-balancer mechanism and DNS returns **A/AAAA records for each backing pod**, rather than a single IP.

---

### 🧪 Why Would You Use It?

Headless services are useful when:

- Each pod needs a **stable network identity**
- Clients need to **connect to pods individually** (not through a load balancer)
- You're using **StatefulSets** (e.g., DB clusters, message queues)

---

### 📦 Example: Headless Service with StatefulSet (MySQL)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-headless
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
```

Pods in a StatefulSet:

```bash
mysql-0.mysql-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
mysql-1.mysql-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
```

This DNS naming allows applications (or clients) to connect directly to `mysql-0`, `mysql-1`, etc.

---

### 💡 Use Case from Experience

> “We used a headless service for a **Kafka cluster**. Each broker needed a stable hostname and had to be discoverable individually for internal communication. The headless service gave us fine-grained control over DNS resolution without load balancing.”

---

### ❗ Key Differences vs Normal Service

| Feature               | ClusterIP Service   | Headless Service      |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| DNS returns          | Single ClusterIP     | Individual Pod IPs     |
| Load balancing       | Yes (Round-robin)    | No                     |
| Use with StatefulSet | ❌ Not ideal         | ✅ Recommended         |
| Use case             | Web apps, APIs       | Databases, Clusters    |

---

### Key takeaway

> "Use headless services when you need DNS-based **direct access** to individual pods — commonly in **StatefulSets** like databases, brokers, and custom peer-to-peer systems."

### Question 64 Can a pod in one namespace access a Service that resides in another namespace? If so, how is it accomplished?

### Answer  Yes. By default, Kubernetes networking is **flat**, so pods can reach services in any namespace. The easiest way is to use the **fully qualified service DNS name**:  
```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```  
If no NetworkPolicies block the traffic, you can simply point your client to that DNS name or the Service’s ClusterIP.


#### 🟢 1. Using the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

Assume you have:

```yaml
# In namespace "backend"
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api
  namespace: backend
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
```

From a pod in **namespace `frontend`** you can reach it via:

```bash
curl http://api.backend.svc.cluster.local:80
```

Kubernetes DNS resolves the service name in this order:

1. `api` (same namespace)  
2. `api.backend`  
3. `api.backend.svc`  
4. `api.backend.svc.cluster.local`

---

#### 🔵 2. Using the ClusterIP (not recommended long-term)

You can also hit the Service’s ClusterIP directly:

```bash
curl http://10.96.24.7:80
```

But this is brittle; IPs can change if the Service is recreated.

---

#### 🛡️ 3. Considerations & Restrictions

| Item                     | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NetworkPolicies**      | By default, traffic is allowed. NetworkPolicies can restrict cross-namespace communication. |
| **RBAC / ServiceAccounts** | DNS reachability ≠ RBAC. If an app calls the API server or needs secrets, RBAC still applies. |
| **Headless Services**    | Same FQDN pattern applies, but DNS returns individual pod IPs.        |

---

#### 💡 Real-world Example

> “Our `frontend` pods needed to call the `payments` API in `payments` namespace. We hard-coded only one ENV var: `PAYMENTS_URL=https://payments.payments.svc.cluster.local:443`. No extra config was required because no NetworkPolicy blocked traffic.”

---

### Key takeaway  

> "Inter-namespace networking works out-of-the-box in Kubernetes. Just use the FQDN `<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. Restrict it only when needed with NetworkPolicies."


### Question  Explain how you would restrict traffic so that only a specific application (pod) can connect to a database pod within the same namespace.

### Answer  Create a **NetworkPolicy** that (1) selects the database pods and (2) allows **ingress** traffic only from pods with a specific label identifying the permitted app. All other traffic is denied by default once the policy is in place.

Kubernetes networking is open by default; any pod can talk to any other pod. NetworkPolicies let you **whitelist** traffic based on pod labels, namespaces, ports, and protocols.

---

#### 🛠 Step-by-step

1. **Label your pods**  
   ```bash
   kubectl label pods db-0 role=db
   kubectl label pods app-0 role=api
   ```
   - `role=db` for the database pod(s)  
   - `role=api` for the app allowed to connect

2. **Create a NetworkPolicy** (YAML below).  
   - **podSelector** matches the DB pods.  
   - **ingress** allows traffic **only** from pods with `role=api` on port 5432.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-app-to-db
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
```

3. **Verify**  
   - `app-0` ➜ `db-0` on port 5432 ✅  
   - Any other pod ➜ `db-0` ❌ (connection refused / timed out)

---

#### 🔍 Why this works

| Component     | Purpose                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `podSelector` | Targets the DB pods (`role=db`).       |
| `from`        | Whitelists only pods with `role=api`.  |
| `ports`       | Optional; further restricts to 5432.   |
| Default deny  | Once a policy exists, all other ingress traffic to the selected pods is blocked unless explicitly allowed. |

---

#### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “We secured a PostgreSQL StatefulSet by labelling it `role=db` and applying an ingress NetworkPolicy. Only the `payments` deployment (labelled `role=payments-api`) could connect. QA pods in the same namespace no longer had DB access unless explicitly whitelisted.”

---

### Key takeaway  

> "Use a NetworkPolicy to _select_ the database pods and _allow_ ingress only from the intended app’s label. This whitelists traffic inside the namespace and blocks everything else by default."


### Question 65 Explain the deployment strategy your team or organization follows for releasing applications to production. Include the rationale and any tooling used.

### Answer  
In our organization, we primarily follow the **Rolling Update strategy** using **Kubernetes Deployments**, combined with **Canary deployments** via tools like **Argo Rollouts** or **Flagger** for critical services. This allows us to ensure zero downtime while gradually releasing new versions, with automated rollback on failure.

### 🔁 1. Rolling Update Strategy (Default in Kubernetes)

This is the default strategy in Kubernetes Deployments:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

- **Old pods are terminated one-by-one**, while **new pods are spun up gradually**.
- Ensures continuous availability with zero downtime.
- Suitable for stateless workloads.

#### Why We Use It:
- Safe and reliable for non-critical changes.
- Works out-of-the-box with minimal setup.
- Easy to observe pod behavior and health during rollout.

---

### 🧪 2. Canary Deployment (for critical changes)

For services that are **business-critical or prone to regression**, we use **Canary deployments** via tools like:

- [Argo Rollouts](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/)
- [Flagger](https://flagger.app/)
- Istio/Linkerd (in some setups)

Canary strategy slowly shifts traffic like:

```
10% new version ➜ 50% ➜ 100%
```

With checks between each step.

#### Benefits:
- We catch issues early with real traffic.
- Automated rollback if metrics or logs indicate failure.
- Controlled and observable releases.

---

### 🚦 3. Blue-Green Deployment (used less frequently)

In rare cases where instant rollback or migration is needed:

- We deploy v2 alongside v1 in full.
- Switch traffic via load balancer or Ingress.
- Instant rollback is possible.

Downsides: resource-heavy, more infra complexity.

---

### ⚙️ Tooling We Use

| Tool              | Purpose                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **ArgoCD**        | GitOps-based deployment management |
| **Argo Rollouts** | Progressive delivery strategies    |
| **Prometheus**    | Monitors health and SLOs           |
| **Helm**          | Templated Kubernetes deployments   |

---

### Real-world Insight

> “During a major upgrade in our user authentication service, we used a **Canary rollout** with Argo Rollouts. We routed 5%, 25%, then 100% traffic after validating performance metrics. Argo Rollouts auto-paused the rollout when latency increased — preventing a major outage.”

---

### Key takeaway  

> "We follow a **Rolling Update** strategy for general use, and **Canary deployments** for critical services. We choose deployment patterns based on service criticality, risk profile, and observability tooling."

### Question 66 Explain how your team handles rollbacks when a deployment goes wrong. What mechanisms or tools are in place to revert a release safely?

### Answer  
We follow an automated **rollback strategy** integrated with our CI/CD system (GitHub Actions + Argo CD). Rollbacks are triggered either **manually via Git revert** or **automatically** if health checks fail during canary or rolling deployments. The GitOps model makes rollbacks clean and reproducible.

### 🔁 GitOps Rollback (Primary Method)

We manage Kubernetes deployments through Git using **Argo CD**.

- **Deployments are version-controlled** as YAML in Git.
- If a deployment breaks production, we simply revert the Git commit.
- Argo CD syncs the previous state back to the cluster.

```bash
git revert <bad-commit>
git push origin main
```

Argo CD picks up the change and rolls back automatically.

#### ✅ Pros:
- Fully auditable
- Consistent rollback to known good state
- Git history = deployment history

---

### 🧪 Canary Rollback (for Progressive Deployments)

For services using **Argo Rollouts**:

- If new version causes latency or errors, the rollout is **paused** automatically.
- The deployment is either auto-rolled back or a manual approval can revert it.

```yaml
analysis:
  templates:
    - templateName: success-rate-check
  args:
    - name: success-rate
      value: "95"
```

If the success rate drops below threshold, the rollout fails.

---

### ⚙️ Helm Rollback (Legacy Services)

For services deployed via Helm:

```bash
helm rollback my-app 2
```

- Lists previous releases and rolls back to a known good version.
- Useful during migration or testing phases.

---

### 🔍 Real-world Scenario

> “We pushed a change to our payment API and started seeing increased 500 errors. Since the deployment was managed by Argo CD, we immediately ran `git revert` and pushed the fix. Within 2 minutes, Argo CD synced the rollback, and the service stabilized without manual intervention in the cluster.”

---

### 🔐 Safeguards We Use

| Strategy                      | Purpose                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Pre-deploy validation         | Prevents pushing broken YAML to Git   |
| Readiness & liveness probes   | Catch bad pods early                   |
| SLO-based auto rollback       | Canary rollouts monitored via metrics |
| Alerts on sync divergence     | Argo CD notifies on drift              |

---

### Key takeaway  

> "Our rollback strategy relies on GitOps principles — reverting Git changes triggers clean, trackable rollbacks. For high-risk deployments, we combine this with automated checks and canary monitoring to catch regressions early."


### Question 67 How would you design a deployment strategy or workflow to **minimize or eliminate the need for rollbacks** after a faulty release?

### Answer  
To avoid rollbacks, we focus on a **“shift-left” strategy** with robust **pre-deployment validation**, **progressive delivery**, and **automated quality gates** using GitOps and observability tools. This ensures that only validated, low-risk changes reach production.


### ✅ 1. Pre-Deployment Safety Nets

| Technique                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Testing**        | Run unit, integration, and regression tests in CI before merge/deploy       |
| **Schema and Config Validation** | Use tools like `kubeval`, `kubeconform`, `opa`, or `tflint` to validate infra code |
| **Security Scanning**        | Run tools like `Trivy`, `Snyk`, or `Checkov` in the pipeline                |
| **Static Code Analysis**     | Linting, code smells, and code coverage enforced via CI tools like SonarQube |

---

### 🚦 2. Use Progressive Delivery

Implement strategies like:

- **Canary deployments** using Argo Rollouts or Flagger
- **Feature flags** to toggle new features without deploying new code
- **Blue-Green deployments** for large releases where rollback speed is critical

These allow testing changes in **real environments** with **real traffic**, minimizing full-scale impact.

---

### 🔍 3. Observability + Quality Gates

Set up **real-time metrics monitoring and alerts** for:

| Type           | Examples                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Latency        | Increase in request duration              |
| Error rate     | 4xx/5xx spike                             |
| Resource usage | Pod CPU/memory usage                      |
| Logs           | Error/warning patterns                    |

Use these metrics in **Argo Rollouts** or **CI pipelines** to auto-pause or fail releases before full rollout.

---

### 🧠 4. Use GitOps for Controlled Deployments

- All deployments happen through Git (e.g. via Argo CD).
- Teams cannot apply YAML manually — reducing human error.
- Any change is traceable, auditable, and reversible.

---

### 🧪 5. Real-World Deployment Guardrails

> “In our CI/CD pipeline, every pull request runs 500+ unit tests, Helm template validations, and schema checks. Once merged, Argo Rollouts begins a canary release to 10% traffic, monitored via Prometheus. We only proceed to 100% if no error spikes are detected within 10 minutes.”

### Question 68 What is the role of **CoreDNS** in a Kubernetes cluster? Why is it important?

### Answer **CoreDNS** is the **default DNS server** used by Kubernetes to provide **service discovery**. It translates internal Kubernetes service names (like `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) into the corresponding Pod IPs or Cluster IPs, enabling communication between pods using DNS instead of hardcoded IP addresses.
- A lightweight, extensible **DNS server** written in Go.
- Replaced **kube-dns** as the default DNS solution since Kubernetes v1.13.
- Deployed as a Kubernetes deployment in the `kube-system` namespace.

### 🧭 Why CoreDNS is critical?

In Kubernetes, services are accessed using DNS names like:

```
http://my-app.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Without CoreDNS:
- Pods wouldn’t be able to resolve service names.
- Inter-pod communication would break.
- Kubernetes' service discovery model would fail.

---

### 🔁 How CoreDNS Works

1. **Pod makes a DNS request** to resolve a service name.
2. The request is sent to the virtual IP `10.96.0.10` (default ClusterIP for CoreDNS).
3. CoreDNS uses Kubernetes API to resolve the DNS query.
4. It returns the appropriate Cluster IP or Pod IP (for headless services).

---

### 🔧 CoreDNS Configuration

The config lives in a **ConfigMap**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
           pods insecure
           fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
        }
        forward . /etc/resolv.conf
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
```

### Question 69 If a node is tainted with a `NoSchedule` taint, is it still possible to schedule a pod on it? If yes, how?

### Answer  Yes, **you can still schedule a pod** on a `NoSchedule` tainted node, but only if the pod has a **matching toleration** for that taint. Without a toleration, the pod will be **ignored by the scheduler** for that node.

### 🧪 What Does Tainting a Node with `NoSchedule` Do?

A taint on a node looks like this:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node-1 env=dev:NoSchedule
```

This tells Kubernetes:
> “Don’t schedule any pods on this node unless the pod explicitly **tolerates** this taint.”

---

### ✅ How to Still Schedule a Pod on That Node?

You add a **toleration** in the pod spec like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: "env"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "dev"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
    - name: demo
      image: nginx
```

This toleration allows the pod to **bypass the NoSchedule restriction** and land on the tainted node.

---

### 📌 Important Notes

| Taint Effect   | Behavior                                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NoSchedule     | Scheduler won’t place pods unless they have a matching toleration    |
| PreferNoSchedule | Tries to avoid, but may still place pods if necessary              |
| NoExecute      | Evicts already-running pods unless they tolerate the taint           |

---

### 🧵 Real-World Use Case

> “We taint certain nodes with `team=analytics:NoSchedule` to dedicate them for heavy data processing. Only pods with that toleration are allowed there — helping us isolate workloads without setting up node pools.”

---

### Key takeaway  

> “Tainting a node with `NoSchedule` blocks pods **by default**, but you can still schedule a pod if it includes a **matching toleration** in its spec. This is how Kubernetes enforces node-level workload isolation.”

### Question 70 Your Kubernetes pod is stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?

### Answer  To troubleshoot a `CrashLoopBackOff`, I would check pod logs, container events, and resource limits. Common causes include application bugs, incorrect configs, failed dependencies, or OOM errors. I’d resolve the root cause based on these findings.

#### 1. 🔎 Check Pod Status and Reason

```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Look under **"Last State"**, **"Exit Code"**, and **"Events"** to understand what’s causing the container crash.

---

#### 2. 📄 View Container Logs

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> --previous -n <namespace>
```

Use `--previous` to see logs from the last failed attempt. You’ll often find stack traces, errors like:

- `Connection refused`
- `File not found`
- `Segmentation fault`
- `Permission denied`

---

#### 3. ⚙️ Check for Configuration or Secret Issues

- Did the pod mount a ConfigMap or Secret that’s missing or misconfigured?
- Are environment variables or command-line arguments set incorrectly?

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

#### 4. 📦 Check for Missing Dependencies

- Is the container trying to connect to a service that’s not running?
- Is a database unavailable or unreachable?
- Are DNS entries resolving?

---

#### 5. 💽 Check Resource Constraints

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

If it shows:
```
Reason: OOMKilled
```
Then the container exceeded memory limits. You’ll need to increase memory in the spec or optimize the application.

---

#### 6. 🐛 Check Image, CMD, ENTRYPOINT

Sometimes the crash is because of:

- Wrong image version
- Entry command missing a binary
- Script missing execute permissions

You can test locally with Docker or `kubectl run` to isolate the issue.

---

#### 7. 🧪 Use Ephemeral Container for Debugging (K8s v1.23+)

```bash
kubectl debug -it <pod-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name>
```

You can inspect volumes, paths, env variables while the pod crashes repeatedly.

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Fix Example

> “In one case, our pod crashed due to a ConfigMap change that removed a required ENV variable. We restored the variable, restarted the pod, and it worked. Another time, we hit an OOMKilled issue and increased memory limits from 256Mi to 512Mi.”

---

### Key takeaway  

> `CrashLoopBackOff` means your container is repeatedly failing and restarting. The fix depends on identifying the **root cause via logs, events, configs, and resource usage** — not just restarting the pod.


### Question 71 What is the difference between **liveness** and **readiness** probes in Kubernetes?

### Answer  **Liveness probes** check if a container is alive and should be restarted if unresponsive.  
**Readiness probes** check if a container is ready to receive traffic. If not, it's removed from the service endpoints until it's ready.

### 💡 What is a Probe?

Probes are periodic checks Kubernetes performs to determine the state of a container.  
There are three types: `liveness`, `readiness`, and `startup`.

---

### 🔁 Liveness Probe

- **Purpose:** Detect if a container is stuck or dead.
- **Behavior:** If the liveness probe fails, the container is **restarted**.
- **Common use case:** Detects application lock-ups (e.g., infinite loops, deadlocks).

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

🧠 Think of this as: “Should this container be killed and restarted?”

---

### 🟢 Readiness Probe

- **Purpose:** Check if the app is **ready to accept traffic**.
- **Behavior:** If the readiness probe fails, the pod is **removed from the service endpoint list**, but **not restarted**.
- **Common use case:** Wait for app to fully initialize before receiving requests.

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3
```

🧠 Think of this as: “Is this container ready to serve traffic?”

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “We had a Java app that took ~40 seconds to load its cache. The readiness probe prevented traffic from hitting it too early, while the liveness probe restarted it if the app crashed during runtime.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Feature            | Liveness Probe             | Readiness Probe              |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Checks if app is   | **Alive**                  | **Ready to serve traffic**   |
| Failure Action     | Restarts the container     | Removes from service routing |
| Restarted on fail? | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                         |
| Affects traffic?   | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                        |

---

### Key takeaway  

> Use **readiness** probes to ensure your app isn’t hit with traffic too early, and **liveness** probes to auto-recover from hangs or crashes.


### Question 72 What is the difference between using an **Ingress** and a **LoadBalancer service** in Kubernetes?

### Answer  A **LoadBalancer** service exposes a single service using a cloud provider’s external load balancer, while **Ingress** acts as a reverse proxy and routes HTTP(S) traffic to multiple services based on rules like hostnames and paths — all using a **single external IP**.

### ⚙️ LoadBalancer Service

- **Creates a cloud provider-managed external load balancer** (like AWS ELB or Azure LB).
- Allocates **one public IP per service**.
- Best for **simple apps** or **non-HTTP protocols** (e.g., TCP, UDP).
- Straightforward setup.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

🧠 Use when you want **external access to a single service** without complex routing.

---

### 🌐 Ingress Resource

- **Acts as an HTTP reverse proxy**.
- Routes requests to different services **based on hostname or path**.
- Uses a **single LoadBalancer IP**, which makes it cost-effective.
- Requires an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB Controller).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

🧠 Use when you want **advanced routing** and to avoid creating multiple public IPs.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Use Case

> “In our microservices app, we had 12 backend services. Instead of creating 12 LoadBalancers, we used Ingress with host-based rules (e.g., api.example.com, auth.example.com) and handled TLS termination at the Ingress controller.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Feature                   | LoadBalancer Service        | Ingress                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| External IP per service   | ✅ Yes (per service)         | ❌ No (shared)                   |
| HTTP routing rules        | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (path/host based)         |
| TLS termination support   | ❌ Manual                    | ✅ Built-in                      |
| Cost efficient            | ❌ More IPs = more cost      | ✅ Single entry point            |
| Handles non-HTTP traffic  | ✅ Yes (TCP/UDP)             | ❌ HTTP/HTTPS only               |
| Requires Ingress Controller | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                           |

---

### Key takeaway  

> Use **LoadBalancer** for exposing a single service directly, and **Ingress** when you want smart routing, TLS, and cost efficiency with multiple services behind one entry point.


### Question 73 You’re able to access your app using its ClusterIP service internally, but it fails when accessed via Ingress. How do you troubleshoot the issue?

### Answer  I would check if the Ingress controller is installed and running, verify the ingress rules, confirm DNS or host header matches, and review logs and service connectivity. Most often, the issue lies in incorrect rules, missing annotations, or DNS misconfiguration.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Process

#### ✅ 1. **Check if Ingress Controller is Installed and Running**

Ingress resources only work if there’s a controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, AWS ALB Controller) running in the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

Make sure it’s in a `Running` state.

---

#### ✅ 2. **Check the Ingress Resource Definition**

```bash
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>
```

- Are the rules defined correctly?
- Are you using correct **`host`** or **`path`**?
- Does the `serviceName` and `port` match your ClusterIP service?

---

#### ✅ 3. **Check Annotations and Class**

Ensure the Ingress has the correct controller class:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
```

Or for newer versions:

```yaml
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

---

#### ✅ 4. **Check DNS or Host Header Configuration**

If you're using a host-based rule like `app.example.com`, make sure:

- DNS points to the ingress controller’s external IP.
- Or you’ve added a line in `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
<ingress-external-ip>  app.example.com
```

If you hit the IP directly but the app uses host-based routing, it may return `404`.

---

#### ✅ 5. **Check Logs of the Ingress Controller**

```bash
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx <controller-pod-name>
```

Common errors include:

- `default backend - 404`
- `no matching path rule`
- TLS errors

---

#### ✅ 6. **Check Backend Service and Pod Health**

Sometimes, the Ingress forwards correctly, but the backend service is broken:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
```

Ensure there are endpoints (pods) behind the service.

---

#### ✅ 7. **Check TLS/HTTPS Configuration**

If using HTTPS, verify:

- TLS secret is valid.
- Rules include `tls` section.
- Ingress controller supports HTTPS.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “Our app worked internally via ClusterIP but gave a 404 over Ingress. It turned out we had a missing `ingressClassName` field, so the resource wasn’t being picked up by the NGINX controller at all.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Check                           | Description                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Ingress Controller Running       | Must be deployed for Ingress to work              |
| Ingress Rules & Paths            | Must match service correctly                      |
| Hostname or Path Match           | Ensure DNS or `/etc/hosts` is correctly configured|
| Logs of Ingress Controller       | Debug routing errors                              |
| Backend Service & Endpoints      | Ensure pods are reachable                         |

---

### Key takeaway  

> If your app works via ClusterIP but not Ingress, the issue is often with the **Ingress configuration**, missing annotations, DNS setup, or **controller not handling the resource**.


### Question 74 Why is it necessary to deploy an **Ingress Controller** after creating an Ingress resource in Kubernetes?

### Answer  The **Ingress resource** is just a set of routing rules. Without an **Ingress Controller**, there is no component to interpret those rules and actually route the external HTTP/HTTPS traffic into the cluster.

### 🔧 What Is an Ingress Resource?

An `Ingress` is a Kubernetes API object that defines how external HTTP(S) traffic should be routed to services in the cluster. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

This defines the rule — **but nothing actually processes it.**

---

### 🚦 What Is an Ingress Controller?

An **Ingress Controller** is the **actual implementation** that reads Ingress rules and configures a proxy (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy, AWS ALB) to route traffic accordingly.

Popular ingress controllers:

- `nginx-ingress`
- `traefik`
- `aws-alb-ingress-controller`
- `gce-ingress-controller`

---

### 🔁 Ingress Without a Controller = No Routing

If you create an Ingress resource **but don’t install a controller**, your traffic won’t be handled at all — the resource will simply sit in the cluster unused.

Example error behavior:
- You try to hit `myapp.example.com`, and nothing responds.
- You might see a `404 default backend` or connection timeout.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “In a new dev cluster, we created an Ingress for our frontend app but couldn’t access it. After some digging, we realized we forgot to install the NGINX ingress controller. Once installed via Helm, the route started working.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Component            | Role                                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ingress Resource     | Specifies rules (host/path/service)                        |
| Ingress Controller   | Watches Ingress resources and implements them via a proxy |
| Result Without Controller | Rules are never executed → traffic not routed        |

---

### Key takeaway  

> **Creating an Ingress resource is not enough**. It’s like writing a script but never running it. You need an **Ingress Controller** to process the rules and handle real-world traffic.


### Question 75 Can an organization use its own **in-house load balancer** in combination with **Kubernetes Ingress**, instead of using a cloud-managed or open-source Ingress controller?

### Answer  Yes, you can use your in-house load balancer **in front of** a Kubernetes Ingress controller. However, the load balancer itself **cannot replace** the Ingress controller — you’ll still need to run an Ingress controller **inside the cluster** to process the Ingress resources.


### ✅ How It Works

In a typical setup:

```
Client --> Load Balancer --> Ingress Controller --> Services --> Pods
```

- The **in-house LB** handles external traffic.
- It forwards requests to the **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX) running inside the cluster.
- The **Ingress Controller** routes traffic based on defined rules in the `Ingress` resource.

---

### 🛑 What You Cannot Do

Your in-house load balancer **cannot**:
- Understand Kubernetes Ingress YAML resources.
- Dynamically route traffic to services or pods based on Kubernetes annotations or labels.

Only an Ingress Controller can interpret and act on the Kubernetes Ingress resources.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “At my previous job, our team had a powerful in-house F5 load balancer. We configured it to forward all `*.company.com` traffic to the NGINX Ingress controller service in our Kubernetes cluster. The F5 handled SSL termination, and NGINX handled path-based routing inside the cluster.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Component               | Role                                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| In-house Load Balancer | Routes traffic to cluster entry point (e.g., NodePort or LoadBalancer service) |
| Ingress Controller      | Understands Ingress resources and routes inside cluster |
| Ingress Resource        | YAML rules for host/path-based routing                 |

---

### 🧠 Recommendation

If your in-house load balancer is smart enough, let it handle:
- TLS termination
- WAF
- Global traffic steering

Then, send traffic to a **NodePort** or **LoadBalancer** service that fronts your **Ingress Controller**.

---

### Key takeaway  

> You **can use your own load balancer**, but it must **send traffic to a running Ingress Controller** inside the cluster. Only the controller can interpret and apply Ingress routing rules.

## Question 76 Your Deployment Has `replicas: 3`, but Only 1 Pod Is Running — What Could Be Wrong?

### Answer  There could be several reasons: resource constraints on nodes, scheduling issues, crashlooping pods, or affinity/taint restrictions that prevent pods from starting.


### 🔍 Troubleshooting Checklist

#### ✅ 1. **Check Pod Statuses**

Run:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app
```

You might see:
- 1 Running
- 2 Pending / CrashLoopBackOff / ImagePullBackOff

---

#### ✅ 2. **Describe the Deployment and Pods**

```bash
kubectl describe deployment my-deployment
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for:
- Events at the bottom (e.g., “failed scheduling”)
- Crash loop messages
- Image pull errors
- Volume mounting errors

---

#### ✅ 3. **Check Node Capacity**

Maybe the other pods can’t be scheduled due to insufficient **CPU/memory**.

Run:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes
```

If the nodes are out of resources, new pods won’t start.

---

#### ✅ 4. **Check Affinity Rules and Taints**

If your deployment or namespace has node affinity or tolerations set, it may restrict where pods can land.

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
                - ssd
```

Pods will only be scheduled on matching nodes.

---

#### ✅ 5. **Check for Pod Crashes**

Run:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

If pods are crashing, Kubernetes may try to restart them, but they'll never stay in the "Running" state.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “We once set a memory limit of `100Mi` in the deployment, but the app needed 200Mi. Only one pod was running because the others kept OOMKilled. Increasing the memory resolved the issue.”

---

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Check                         | What It Tells You                           |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `kubectl get pods`           | Status of all pods                          |
| `kubectl describe`           | Events and reasons for pending/crashes      |
| Node capacity                | Resource exhaustion                         |
| Affinity/Taints              | Constraints preventing scheduling           |
| Container logs               | Runtime crashes or app issues               |

---

### Key takeaway

> If `replicas: 3` but only 1 pod is running, start by checking pod status, node resource limits, crash logs, and affinity/taint rules. The issue is often with scheduling or container-level crashes.


## Question 77 Your Pod Mounts a ConfigMap, but Changes to the ConfigMap Are Not Reflected — Why?

### Answer  If the ConfigMap is mounted as a **volume**, Kubernetes does reflect changes, but only inside the container **after a short delay** (default: every 1–2 minutes). However, if your application reads the config **only once at startup**, changes won't be picked up unless the pod is restarted.

### 🔍 Understanding ConfigMap Mount Behavior

When you mount a ConfigMap as a volume:
```yaml
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config

volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/my-config
```

- The files in `/etc/my-config` are updated by kubelet **every ~1 minute**.
- The container sees the new file contents — but **only if** it accesses the file **again**.

---

### 🤔 Why Changes Might Not Be Reflected

1. **App only reads config on startup**  
   Some apps cache configuration in memory. Even if the file changes, the app doesn’t reload it.

2. **Change detection delay**  
   Kubelet updates the mounted files on a **periodic sync** (not instant).

3. **You edited the wrong ConfigMap**  
   Make sure you're updating the one actually mounted in the pod.

4. **You edited the ConfigMap, but didn't trigger a redeploy**  
   If your app needs a restart to pick up the config, trigger a rollout:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment <name>
   ```

---

### ✅ Best Practices to Handle This

- Use **watchers or inotify** in your app to re-read files.
- Or use **environment variables** (from `envFrom` or `env`) instead, but these require a **pod restart** to take effect.
- Consider adding `checksum/config` annotations to trigger rollout on changes:

```yaml
annotations:
  checksum/config: {{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/configmap.yaml") . | sha256sum }}
```

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “We had a backend service that read a YAML config from a ConfigMap. Even though we changed the ConfigMap, the app behavior didn’t change. Turned out the app loaded config at startup. We fixed it by adding a `rollout restart` step to the deployment job.”

| Reason                        | Description                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| App reads config only once   | File updated, app doesn’t reload it         |
| Kubelet delay                | File update sync happens every 1–2 minutes  |
| Wrong ConfigMap              | Editing a different resource                |
| ConfigMap used as env vars   | Requires pod restart                        |

---

### Key takeaway

> When mounting ConfigMaps as volumes, changes are synced to the file system — but your app must re-read the files to reflect them. If it doesn’t, restart the pod or redeploy the workload.


## Question 78 How Node Affinity Works in Kubernetes and When to Use It

### Answer **Node Affinity** lets you constrain which nodes a pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. It’s useful when certain workloads must run on specific types of nodes — like GPU nodes, SSD-backed nodes, or nodes in specific availability zones.

### 🎯 What Is Node Affinity?

Kubernetes nodes can have labels like:

```bash
key = disktype
value = ssd
```

Node affinity lets you **require or prefer** that pods run only on nodes with specific labels.

---

### 🔧 Types of Node Affinity

1. **requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**
   - Hard rule: Pod **won’t schedule** unless the rule is met.
   - Example: Only run on GPU nodes.

2. **preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**
   - Soft rule: Pod **prefers** to run on a node but can fall back to others.
   - Example: Prefer zone `us-east-1a`, but any zone is okay.

---

### 📦 Example YAML (Required Affinity)

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
                - ssd
```

This pod will only be scheduled on nodes labeled with `disktype=ssd`.

---

### ✅ When Would You Use It?

| Use Case | Why Use Node Affinity |
|----------|------------------------|
| GPU workloads | Run pods only on GPU nodes (`gpu=true`) |
| Zone/locality awareness | Pin workloads to a specific zone |
| Storage constraints | Run only on SSD-backed nodes |
| Licensing/Compliance | Restrict workloads to labeled nodes for compliance |

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “We had a mixed node pool — some with SSDs, some with spinning disks. Our database pods needed fast disk access. We labeled SSD nodes with `disktype=ssd` and used `nodeAffinity` to ensure they only ran there.”

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to label nodes.
- Using `required` when you should use `preferred`, leading to scheduling failures.
- Using node selectors (`nodeSelector`) for complex rules instead of `nodeAffinity`.

---

### Summary Table

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `requiredDuringScheduling...` | Must meet label to be scheduled | Critical workloads |
| `preferredDuringScheduling...` | Prefer label but not mandatory | Best-effort distribution |

---

### Key takeaway

> **Node Affinity** gives you fine-grained control over where your pods are scheduled — based on node labels. Use it to improve performance, availability, and compliance by matching the right workload to the right node.

## Question 79 What is the Difference Between Node Affinity and Node Label Selector?

### Answer  `nodeSelector` is a simple way to schedule pods on nodes with a specific label (only supports equality). `nodeAffinity` is more expressive — it supports multiple match conditions, operators like `In`, `NotIn`, and provides both **required** and **preferred** rules.

### 🛠️ nodeSelector — The Simpler Way

`nodeSelector` is the original and most basic method to assign pods to nodes based on labels.

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

- It only supports **exact match (key = value)**.
- If no matching node exists, the pod **won’t schedule**.

---

### 🔧 nodeAffinity — The Advanced Way

Introduced in Kubernetes 1.6+, `nodeAffinity` provides more control:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
                - ssd
```

- Supports multiple operators: `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, etc.
- Can define **hard (required)** and **soft (preferred)** scheduling rules.
- Better suited for **complex or evolving scheduling logic**.

---

### 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature                      | `nodeSelector`             | `nodeAffinity`                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Supported operators          | Only `=`                    | `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, etc. |
| Rule type                    | Only required               | Required or Preferred                       |
| Multiple label match support | ❌                          | ✅                                          |
| Flexibility                  | Low                         | High                                        |
| Readability for complex rules| Hard to maintain            | Easier and more structured                  |

---

### 🧪 Real-World Analogy

> Think of `nodeSelector` like a basic filter (“I want apples”), whereas `nodeAffinity` is like a full search query (“I want either green or red apples, but prefer red”).

---

### ✅ When to Use What?

| Use Case | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick filtering with one label | `nodeSelector` |
| Match multiple conditions or use preferences | `nodeAffinity` |

---

### Key takeaway

> Use `nodeSelector` for simple one-label matches, but switch to `nodeAffinity` when you need expressive logic, multiple label conditions, or soft placement preferences.

## Question 80 What is a Container Runtime in Kubernetes?

### Answer  A **container runtime** in Kubernetes is the software responsible for **running containers**. It pulls container images, starts containers, stops them, and manages their lifecycle on each node in the cluster. Examples include **containerd**, **CRI-O**, and previously **Docker**.

### 🧱 What Exactly Does a Container Runtime Do?

On every Kubernetes worker node, there is a container runtime which:

- **Pulls the container image** from a registry (like Docker Hub, ECR, etc.).
- **Unpacks** and **runs** the container in an isolated environment.
- **Reports container status** back to the Kubelet.
- **Stops** and **removes** containers as needed.

It's like the engine that powers your containers behind the scenes.

---

### 🔗 How Does It Fit in Kubernetes?

The **Kubelet** (agent running on each worker node) interacts with the container runtime using the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.

Kubelet → CRI → Container Runtime (e.g., containerd)

---

### 🎯 Popular Container Runtimes

| Runtime      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **containerd** | Lightweight, core container runtime. Now default in most Kubernetes distributions. |
| **CRI-O**       | Purpose-built for Kubernetes. Used by OpenShift and others. |
| **Docker**      | Previously used directly, but deprecated in Kubernetes since v1.20+. |

> Kubernetes does **not** require Docker as a runtime anymore — it uses `containerd` or `CRI-O` via CRI.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “In our EKS cluster, we noticed that some pods were slow to start. On investigating, we found the node’s container runtime `containerd` had image pull backoff issues. Restarting the `containerd` service and pre-pulling images helped fix the issue.”

---

### 🧵 Related Concepts

- **CRI**: Interface between Kubelet and the runtime.
- **OCI**: Open Container Initiative — defines container image and runtime standards.

---

### Key takeaway

> A container runtime is the backend engine in Kubernetes responsible for running and managing containers. It works under the hood with the Kubelet via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to ensure your pods run correctly.
