- Developers push code to repositories (**GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket**).  
- CI/CD tools trigger **automated builds and tests** on new commits.  

### **7. What is the purpose of unit tests in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Unit tests validate **individual components of code** to catch early-stage bugs.  

- Tools: **JUnit, pytest, Mocha, Jest**  
- Example:  

  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
  
  def test_add():
      assert add(2, 3) == 5
  ```  

### **8. What is versioning in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Versioning assigns unique numbers to each software release to track changes.  

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., **1.2.3**)  
- **Git Tags:** CI/CD pipelines deploy specific versions using tags.  

### **9. What is a rollback in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A rollback reverts to a previous stable release when the new deployment fails.  

- Example: Rolling back an application using Kubernetes:  

  ```sh
  kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app
  ```  

### **10. What is a canary deployment?**  

**Answer:**  
Canary deployment releases new changes to a **subset of users** before full deployment.  

- Example: **Deploy to 10% of users → Monitor logs → Full release**

  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } }
      stage('Test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } }
    }
  }
  ```  

### **27. What is an ephemeral build environment in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
An **ephemeral build environment** is a temporary environment spun up **only during the build process** and discarded after execution.

A **monorepo** is a single repository for multiple projects/services.  

- **Challenges:**  
  - Running **CI/CD for only changed services** can be complex.  
  - **Large build times** if not optimized.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use **Bazel, NX, or GitHub Actions path filters** to build/test only **modified code**.  

### **30. What are pipeline triggers, and how are they used?**  

**Answer:**  
Triggers **automatically start CI/CD workflows** based on specific events.  

- **Examples:**  
  - **Git Push:** Run pipeline when new code is pushed.  
  - **Pull Requests:** Trigger tests before merging.  
  - **Schedule:** Run a job every night (`cron`).  
- **Example GitLab CI/CD trigger:**  

  ```yaml
  trigger:
    event: push
  ```  

### **31. What is artifact versioning in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Versioning assigns **unique identifiers** to builds for tracking.  

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use **Semantic Versioning (1.2.3)** for clarity.  
  - Tag artifacts using commit hashes (`v1.0.0-commitSHA`).  
- **Example:**  

  ```sh
  docker tag my-app:latest my-app:1.2.3
  ```  

### **32. How do you handle environment variables in CI/CD?**

**Answer:**  
A **multi-branch pipeline** runs different workflows for different Git branches.  

- **Example (Jenkins):**  
  - `main` → Deploy to production.  
  - `develop` → Deploy to staging.  
- **Jenkinsfile example:**  

  ```groovy
  if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'main') {
      deployToProd()
  } else {
      deployToStaging()
  }
  ```  

### **34. How do you automate rollback in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
If a deployment fails, CI/CD should **automatically revert to a stable version**.  

- **Strategies:**  
  - **Git Revert:** Roll back code changes.  
  - **Kubernetes Rollback:** `kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app`.  
  - **Feature Flags:** Disable a new feature without redeployment.  

### **35. What is test-driven development (TDD), and how does it integrate with CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
TDD means **writing tests before writing code**.  

- **CI/CD Best Practice:**  
  - Run unit tests **before merging code**.  
  - Block deployment if tests fail.  
- **Example:**  

  ```python
  def test_addition():
      assert add(2, 3) == 5
  ```  

### **36. How do you handle dependencies in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

**Answer:**  
Managing dependencies ensures **consistent builds**.

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```  

### **43. What is parallel execution in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Parallel execution runs multiple tasks **simultaneously** to speed up pipelines.  

- Example: Running multiple tests at once in Jenkins.  

### **44. What is dynamic vs. static analysis in CI/CD security?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Static Analysis:** Scans code **before execution** (e.g., SonarQube).  
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Scans code **during runtime** (e.g., OWASP ZAP).  

### **45. What is a feature flag, and how does it work in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A feature flag enables/disables features without deploying new code.  

- Example: Toggle dark mode using a flag instead of redeploying.  

### **46. How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines?**  

**Answer:**  

- Use **environment variables** securely.  
- Store secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault**.  
- Example:

  secrets:
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  ```  

### **47. What is observability in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Observability means **monitoring logs, metrics, and traces** to debug CI/CD failures.  

### **48. What is immutable infrastructure?**  

**Answer:**  
Immutable infrastructure means **servers are never updated** but replaced instead.  

### **49. What are the key metrics for CI/CD performance?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Lead Time:** Time from commit to deployment.  
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Time to recover from failures.  

### **50. How do you ensure zero-downtime deployments?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Use rolling updates, blue-green, and canary deployments.**  
- **Deploy with Kubernetes and load balancers.**  

### **51. What is a release train in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A **release train** is a deployment strategy where software releases are scheduled at **fixed intervals**, rather than waiting for all features to be ready.  

- Common in **Agile** environments.  
- Ensures **predictability** and **reduces deployment risks**.  
- Example: **Google Chrome** releases every 4 weeks regardless of pending features.  

### **52. How do you handle database migrations in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

**Answer:**  
Database migrations ensure **schema changes** are applied safely in an automated pipeline.  

- Use tools like **Liquibase, Flyway, Django Migrations**.  
- Steps in CI/CD:  
  1. **Check migrations** before deployment (`liquibase validate`).  
  2. **Apply migrations** during deployment (`flyway migrate`).  
  3. **Rollback if failure** (`flyway undo`).  
- Example in a pipeline (Flyway):  

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Apply database migrations
      run: flyway migrate -url=jdbc:mysql://db -user=root -password=secret
  ```  

### **53. What is trunk-based development, and how does it impact CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Trunk-based development means developers **commit directly to the main branch** (trunk) instead of using long-lived feature branches.  

- **Pros:**  
  - **Faster CI/CD cycles** with fewer merge conflicts.  
  - Reduces integration complexity.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires **strict automated testing** to prevent breaking changes.  
- Example workflow:  
  - Commit to `main` → Automated Tests → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production.  

### **54. How do you implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  
A **blue-green deployment** runs **two versions** of an application simultaneously, allowing **instant rollback** if issues occur.  

- Steps:  
  1. Deploy **new version (green)** while **old version (blue) stays live**.  
  2. Switch traffic to green using a **load balancer or Ingress**.  
  3. Rollback if issues arise by redirecting traffic back to blue.  
- Example Kubernetes YAML:  

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: blue-green
  spec:
    rules:
      - http:
          paths:
            - path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: green-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```  

### **55. What is a service mesh, and how does it help CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A **service mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling **service-to-service communication** in microservices.  

- Examples: **Istio, Linkerd, Consul**.  
- Benefits in CI/CD:  
  - **Canary deployments**: Route traffic gradually.  
  - **A/B Testing**: Split traffic between versions.  
  - **Security**: Implements zero-trust policies (e.g., **mTLS**).  

### **56. What is progressive delivery in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Progressive delivery is an **evolution of CI/CD** that deploys features gradually, rather than all at once.  

- **Includes:**  
  - **Feature Flags:** Enable/disable features dynamically.  
  - **Canary Releases:** Test with a small user group first.  
  - **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions for analytics.  

### **57. How do you handle long-running tests in CI/CD pipelines?**  

**Answer:**  
Long-running tests slow down deployments. Strategies to optimize:  

- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run tests across multiple machines.  
- **Test Selection:** Run only impacted tests using **test impact analysis**.  
- **Mocking Dependencies:** Reduce external calls using **Mockito, WireMock**.  
- **Shift-Left Testing:** Run tests **early in the pipeline** to detect failures faster.  

### **58. What is Chaos Engineering, and how does it fit into CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Chaos Engineering involves **intentionally injecting failures** to test system resilience.  

- **Example tools:**  
  - **Gremlin, LitmusChaos** (Kubernetes-based).  
  - **AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)**.  
- **In CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  - Add a **chaos test stage** before production deployment.  
  - Example:  

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Run Chaos Test
        run: gremlin attack --target kubernetes --cpu 90%
    ```  

### **59. How do you implement immutable deployments in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Immutable deployments mean **never modifying running instances**—instead, deploying a new version entirely.  

- Best for **containers, serverless, and cloud-native applications**.  
- Tools:  
  - **Docker images** (`image: my-app:v2`).  
  - **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)** to replace instances.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Bad approach:** `ssh into a server & update the app`.  
  - **Good approach:** `Deploy a new container & replace old one`.  

### **60. What are the best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines?**  

**Answer:**  
To secure CI/CD, follow **these best practices**:  
✅ **Use Secret Management:** Store secrets in **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**.  
✅ **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict who can trigger deployments.  
✅ **Enforce Code Signing:** Sign artifacts to ensure they are not tampered with.  
✅ **Run Security Scans:** Use **SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning** tools.  
✅ **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines:** Detect suspicious activity using **SIEM tools** like Splunk or Datadog.  

### **61. What are Jenkins Shared Libraries and how do they work?**

## ✅ Answer  

---
Jenkins Shared Libraries allow you to **centralize reusable pipeline code** (like functions, steps, and variables) across multiple pipelines. They promote **code reuse**, **maintainability**, and **consistency** in large Jenkins setups.

### 📘 What is a Jenkins Shared Library?

A **Shared Library** is a Git repository (or part of one) that contains reusable Groovy code you can include in Jenkins pipelines using the `@Library` annotation.

It typically includes:
```
(root)
├── vars/
│   └── sayHello.groovy
├── src/
│   └── org/example/MyClass.groovy
├── resources/
│   └── templates/config.xml
└── README.md
```

---

### 🧠 Why Use Shared Libraries?

- Avoid repeating logic in every Jenkinsfile  
- Encapsulate business logic, deployment steps, or validation code  
- Easy updates across all pipelines  
- Fewer errors and better collaboration  

---

### ⚙️ How Do They Work?

1. **Create a Git repo** with a specific structure (`vars/`, `src/`, etc.).
2. Configure the library in Jenkins:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins → Global Pipeline Libraries**.
   - Add your library by name and Git URL.
3. In your Jenkinsfile, you load the library:
   ```groovy
   @Library('my-shared-library') _
   ```
4. Use global functions or classes defined in `vars/` or `src/`.

---

### 🔍 Example

**vars/sayHello.groovy**
```groovy
def call(String name = 'world') {
    echo "Hello, ${name}!"
}
```

**Jenkinsfile**
```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Greet') {
            steps {
                sayHello('Abhishek')
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Benefits

- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Cleaner Jenkinsfiles
- Version-controlled and auditable
- Easier team collaboration

---

> Summary:  
> Jenkins Shared Libraries allow you to **modularize and reuse pipeline logic** across projects. They are ideal for **large-scale CI/CD environments** where consistency and maintainability are key.

## **62. Talk about 5 build targets that you use on a day-to-day basis in Maven.**

### 📝 Short Explanation  
Maven uses **build lifecycle phases** (also called build targets) to automate project compilation, packaging, testing, and deployment. These phases are executed using `mvn <goal>` commands.

## ✅ Answer  

Here are 5 Maven build targets I commonly use in my day-to-day workflow:

---

### 1. `mvn clean`
- **Purpose:** Deletes the `target/` directory to ensure a clean slate before a new build.
- **When I use it:** Before any fresh build to avoid conflicts from previous build artifacts.

---

### 2. `mvn compile`
- **Purpose:** Compiles the source code in the `src/main/java` directory.
- **When I use it:** To verify that there are no compilation issues before moving to packaging.

---

### 3. `mvn test`
- **Purpose:** Runs unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG.
- **When I use it:** Regularly during development or in CI pipelines to ensure code stability.

---

### 4. `mvn package`
- **Purpose:** Packages the compiled code into a distributable format like a `.jar` or `.war`.
- **When I use it:** When the build is stable and I need to generate an artifact.

---

### 5. `mvn install`
- **Purpose:** Installs the built artifact into the **local Maven repository** (`~/.m2/repository`) so it can be used by other local projects.
- **When I use it:** When I’m developing shared libraries or modules that are reused by other internal projects.

---

> Summary:  
> The most frequently used Maven targets in my daily work include: `clean`, `compile`, `test`, `package`, and `install`. They ensure a complete and reliable build pipeline from development to artifact distribution.

---

### **63. Which artifact repository do you use for builds?

## ✅ Answer  
An artifact repository is a storage system where you can **publish**, **store**, and **retrieve** build artifacts like `.jar`, `.war`, Docker images, etc. It’s crucial in modern CI/CD pipelines for dependency management and versioning.
In our organization, we use **JFrog Artifactory** as our primary artifact repository for builds.

---

### 📘 Why JFrog Artifactory?

- **Supports multiple package formats** (Maven, npm, Docker, PyPI, Helm, etc.)
- **Integration with Jenkins & GitHub Actions** for publishing artifacts during CI/CD.
- **Proxying public repositories** like Maven Central or Docker Hub to improve speed and reliability.
- **Access control and security** via RBAC for different teams and projects.
- **Retention policies** to clean up outdated builds automatically.

---

### 🔄 Typical Workflow

1. Developer commits code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins triggers a build and packages the application using Maven.
3. The artifact is pushed to Artifactory using `mvn deploy`.
4. Later stages (like deployment) pull the artifact from Artifactory.

---

### 🧠 Alternatives I've worked with:
- **Sonatype Nexus Repository** – Lightweight and easy to set up for Maven-only use cases.
- **AWS CodeArtifact** – Great for AWS-native environments.
- **GitHub Packages** – Useful for open-source projects or tight GitHub integrations.

---

> Summary:  
> My go-to artifact repository is **JFrog Artifactory** due to its versatility, wide ecosystem support, and strong integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### **64. How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines?**
### 📝 Short Explanation
Handling secrets in CI/CD pipelines is crucial for security. Secrets include API keys, database passwords, and other sensitive information that should not be hardcoded in the codebase or exposed in logs.
## ✅ Answer
Here are some best practices for managing secrets in CI/CD pipelines:
1. **Use Environment Variables**  
   - Store secrets as environment variables in the CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables).
   - Access them in your pipeline scripts without hardcoding.
    - Example in GitHub Actions:
    ```yaml
    env:
      DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
    ```
2. **Secrets Management Tools**  
   - Use dedicated tools like **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, or **Azure Key Vault** to store and manage secrets securely.
   - Integrate these tools with your CI/CD pipeline to fetch secrets dynamically.
   - Example using AWS Secrets Manager in a script:
    ```bash
    DB_PASSWORD=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id my-db-secret --query SecretString --output text)
    ```
3. **Encryption**  
   - Encrypt sensitive files or configuration data before committing them to the repository.
   - Use tools like **GPG** or built-in encryption features of CI/CD tools.
   - Example using GPG:
    ```bash
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 my-secret-file.txt
    ```
4. **Access Control** 
   - Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict who can access and modify secrets.
   - Ensure only authorized users and services can access sensitive information.
5. **Audit and Monitoring**  
   - Regularly audit access to secrets and monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
   - Use logging and alerting to detect suspicious activities.
6. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**  
   - Never hardcode secrets directly in the codebase or configuration files.
   - Use placeholders or environment variables instead. 
- Example:
    ```yaml
    # Bad practice
    db_password: "my-secret-password" 
    # Good practice
    db_password: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
    ``` 
7. **Rotate Secrets Regularly**  
   - Implement a process to rotate secrets periodically to minimize the risk of exposure.
   - Use automation to update secrets in the CI/CD pipeline without downtime.
8. **Use Secret Scanning Tools**  
   - Integrate secret scanning tools like **GitGuardian** or **TruffleHog** to detect accidentally committed secrets in the codebase.
   - Set up alerts for any detected secrets to take immediate action.

### **66. CI Pipeline Succeeds but App is Broken in Prod — What Action Will You Take?**

## ✅ Answer  

I treat this as a **critical incident** and approach it using a mix of **debugging**, **rollbacks**, and **preventive actions** for the future.
If the CI/CD pipeline passes but the application breaks in production, it suggests that something is **missing in the validation phase**, or there are **environment mismatches** between staging/CI and production.
---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Approach

#### 1. 🔥 **Initiate Incident Response**
- Notify the team. Document the issue.
- If user-facing and severe, consider triggering an **automated rollback** or **manual redeploy of the last working version**.

#### 2. 🧪 **Check Prod Logs and Monitoring**
- View logs using ELK, CloudWatch, or your observability stack.
- Check:
  - HTTP status codes (500s, 4xx)
  - Application logs
  - Metrics: memory, CPU, DB errors, timeouts

#### 3. 🔁 **Compare Staging and Production**
- Is staging missing any:
  - Environment variables?
  - Backend services?
  - Feature flags?
- Confirm the **artifact promoted to prod** is the same tested in staging.

#### 4. 🔐 **Check Secrets and External Integrations**
- API keys, third-party integrations, database credentials — misconfigured or rotated tokens can break production unexpectedly.

#### 5. 🧾 **Check Infrastructure Differences**
- Is production using a different:
  - Kubernetes namespace?
  - Load balancer config?
  - Terraform state?
- Sometimes prod has older AMIs, different volumes, or a custom security group.

---

### ✅ Immediate Actions

- **Rollback if feasible** (using Git tags, Helm chart versions, AMI snapshots).
- **Create a postmortem** entry and assign root cause analysis (RCA).
- **Patch with hotfix** only after RCA is complete.

---

### 🛠️ Preventive Measures Going Forward

- Add **automated smoke tests** after deployment.
- Integrate **canary releases** or **blue-green deployments**.
- Enforce staging and production **parity** in environments.
- Validate secrets and config before each deployment.
- Enable alerting for anomalies immediately after deployment.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

After a successful CI build and deployment, the app was broken in prod because a staging-only environment variable (`USE_MOCK_SERVICE=true`) was hardcoded and not overridden in production.

🔧 Fix: Added proper `values-prod.yaml` for Helm, separated environments clearly, and added smoke tests post-deploy.

---

> Summary:  
> A CI pipeline success doesn’t always guarantee production stability. I validate logs, environment parity, secrets, and roll back if needed. Going forward, I strengthen post-deploy checks and staging fidelity.

---

### **67. Pipeline Slows Down Over Time (Builds taking more time) — How Will You Fix?**

## ✅ Answer  
If a CI pipeline is progressively getting slower, it's likely due to **accumulated build artifacts**, **unoptimized steps**, **lack of caching**, or **resource saturation** on the runner/agent.
When I notice that builds are getting slower over time, I take a **metrics-driven approach** to isolate the slowdown and optimize the pipeline stages.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Approach

#### 1. 📊 **Measure Stage Durations Over Time**
- Use CI tool metrics (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab) or integrate Prometheus/Grafana.
- Identify **which stage(s)** are consuming more time — code checkout, dependency resolution, test execution, build packaging, etc.

---

#### 2. 📦 **Check Dependency Management**
- Over time, dependency trees can grow.
- Use tools like:
  - `mvn dependency:analyze`
  - `npm prune`
- Cache dependencies (e.g., `~/.m2`, `node_modules`) between runs to avoid full re-downloads.

---

#### 3. 💾 **Enable Layered and Incremental Builds**
- Avoid cleaning entire workspace unless necessary (`mvn clean install` can be expensive).
- Use incremental build options:
  - Gradle: `--build-cache`
  - Bazel: native caching
  - Docker: use layers wisely and avoid invalidating cache

---

#### 4. 🧼 **Clean Up Disk and Workspace**
- Runners may accumulate:
  - Gigabytes of build artifacts
  - Old Docker images and volumes
- Use scheduled jobs or add cleanup logic:
  ```bash
  docker system prune -af
  ```

---

#### 5. 🚀 **Use Parallelism and Matrix Builds**
- Split long test suites or build steps using:
  - `strategy.matrix` in GitHub Actions
  - `parallel` stages in Jenkins pipelines

---

#### 6. ⚙️ **Review Runner/Agent Resource Utilization**
- Check CPU, memory, disk I/O on build agents.
- Use autoscaling runners or move to faster instance types if needed.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

We noticed our build time increased from 7 to 19 minutes over 6 months.  
Root cause:  
- Increased number of tests without parallel execution  
- Outdated Docker layers not using cache  

✅ Fixes implemented:
- Introduced parallel test stages  
- Refactored Dockerfile to leverage cache better  
- Cleaned up unused images on runners weekly  

---

> Summary:  
> When a pipeline slows down, I:
> - Measure and isolate the slowdown  
> - Optimize dependencies and builds  
> - Use caching and parallelism  
> - Clean up workspace and review resource usage

---

### **68. A developer pushes a feature branch, but the pipeline doesn’t trigger in GitHub Actions. What could be wrong?**

## ✅ Answer  
If a GitHub Actions pipeline doesn’t trigger when a branch is pushed, it's usually due to **misconfigured trigger rules**, **file path filters**, or **workflow scope issues**.
When this happens, I check the following areas step-by-step to isolate and fix the issue.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

#### 1. 🔍 **Check the `on:` Section in the Workflow**
- GitHub Actions triggers are defined under the `on:` field. Make sure it includes `push` and relevant branches.

**Example of incorrect config (only main branch will trigger):**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

**Fix: include `feature/*` pattern or all branches:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'feature/*'
      - 'dev'
```

---

#### 2. 📁 **Check `paths` Filter (if used)**
If the workflow has a `paths:` filter, it will only trigger if specific files are changed.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
```

If a developer changed a file outside the listed paths, the pipeline won’t trigger.

---

#### 3. 🧪 **Check if the Workflow File is on Default Branch**
- Workflows stored in `.github/workflows/` must exist on the **default branch** (usually `main`) to trigger from other branches.

If the workflow file was only added in the `feature/xyz` branch, it won’t trigger on push unless merged to the main branch.

---

#### 4. 🔒 **Check Branch Protection or Permissions**
- If GitHub Actions is disabled for the repo or workflow permissions are restricted (`Settings → Actions → General`), it may block pipeline execution.

---

#### 5. 🧼 **Verify `.github/workflows/*.yml` File Validity**
- Run `act` locally or use the **GitHub Actions → Logs** to check for YAML syntax errors.
- A broken workflow file might silently fail to register triggers.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Fix

A developer pushed to `feature/payment-refactor`, but the workflow didn’t run.  
We found that:
- The `on.push.branches` section only had `main` and `develop`.
- After updating it to include `'feature/*'`, it started working as expected.

---

> Summary:  
> If GitHub Actions doesn’t trigger on feature branch push:
> - Check `on.push.branches` config
> - Ensure no blocking `paths:` filter
> - Confirm workflow file exists on default branch
> - Validate repo settings and workflow file syntax

---

### **69. Your build fails because it can’t download a dependency from your artifact repository. What will you do?**

## ✅ Answer  
A failed dependency download usually indicates an issue with **repository configuration**, **authentication**, **connectivity**, or **artifact availability**.
When a build fails to fetch a dependency from an artifact repo (e.g., Artifactory, Nexus, AWS CodeArtifact), I debug it systematically.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

#### 1. 🔍 **Check the Build Error Message**
- Identify the exact dependency and which repo URL it tried to hit.
- Note if it’s a `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, or a timeout.

---

#### 2. 🗂️ **Verify Repository Configuration**
- Check your `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or `.npmrc` to ensure the **repository URL is correct**.

✅ For Maven:
```xml
<repository>
  <id>company-repo</id>
  <url>https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/libs-release</url>
</repository>
```

---

#### 3. 🔐 **Check Credentials**
- Verify credentials in `~/.m2/settings.xml` or environment variables are correct and not expired.

✅ Sample settings.xml:
```xml
<server>
  <id>company-repo</id>
  <username>${env.ARTIFACT_USER}</username>
  <password>${env.ARTIFACT_PASS}</password>
</server>
```

> Tip: Some tokens (e.g., AWS CodeArtifact) expire and need to be refreshed via CLI.

---

#### 4. 🌐 **Test Repo Connectivity**
- Manually curl the artifact URL to check if it is reachable:
```bash
curl -I https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/libs-release/...
```

- Check for proxy/firewall/DNS issues especially in CI environments.

---

#### 5. 📦 **Check If the Artifact Exists**
- Log into the artifact repository UI and confirm:
  - The artifact version exists
  - The repository hasn’t been deleted or archived

---

#### 6. 🛠️ **Try a Local Build with Clean Cache**
- Delete local repo cache and try again:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/<group>/<artifact>
mvn clean install
```

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

We once faced this with `mvn install` failing in Jenkins.  
Reason: The **CodeArtifact token had expired**, but Jenkins was still using the old token via environment variable.

✅ Fix:  
- Added a step in Jenkinsfile to refresh the token before the build:
```bash
aws codeartifact get-authorization-token ...
```

---

> Summary:  
> When a build fails due to missing dependencies, I:
> - Check error logs and repo URL
> - Validate credentials and token freshness
> - Confirm repo and artifact existence
> - Test connectivity manually
> - Clean local cache and retry

### **70. Python Build Fails on CI But Works Locally — What Can Be the Issue?**

## ✅ Answer  
This typically happens due to **differences in environment**, **missing dependencies**, **version mismatches**, or **missing credentials** between your local machine and the CI environment.

I systematically compare the local and CI environments and address issues related to Python version, packages, permissions, and environment variables.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

#### 1. 🐍 **Check Python Version**
- Your local machine might use Python 3.11, but the CI runner may default to Python 3.6.
```bash
python --version
```
✅ Fix: Pin the Python version in your CI configuration (e.g., in GitHub Actions):
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
```

---

#### 2. 📦 **Check Dependency Installation**
- Make sure you're installing dependencies from a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
- If CI doesn't install dependencies or installs different ones due to version pinning, the build may fail.

✅ Fix:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### 3. 📁 **Check Missing Files/Modules**
- CI systems start from a clean environment. Ensure all required files (e.g., `.env`, `config.yaml`, local modules) are **checked into Git** or provided securely.

---

#### 4. 🔐 **Check for Missing Secrets**
- Locally, your credentials (e.g., AWS, database) might be stored in `.env`, but CI needs them as **environment variables** or **secret manager injections**.

✅ Fix in GitHub Actions:
```yaml
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

---

#### 5. 🧪 **Run Tests Verbosely**
- In CI, run tests with verbose output:
```bash
pytest -v
```
- It helps pinpoint the exact failure, such as ImportError, ModuleNotFound, or permission issues.

---

#### 6. 📦 **Check for C Extension Issues**
- Some Python packages require system-level dependencies (e.g., `psycopg2`, `lxml`).
- These might be installed on your machine, but not available in the CI container.

✅ Fix: Add dependencies via `apt` before pip install:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev
pip install psycopg2
```

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

A Flask app was building fine locally but failed in GitHub Actions CI.  
Reason: The app used `python-dotenv`, but `.env` file was not available in CI, and environment variables were not set.

✅ Fix:
- Added secrets in GitHub → Repository Settings → Secrets
- Injected them in the pipeline using `env:`

---

> Summary:  
> When a Python build fails in CI but works locally,
> - Check version differences  
> - Validate dependency installation  
> - Ensure all required files and env vars are available  
> - Review system-level dependencies and module paths

---

### **71. Explain the Python Application Build Process in Detail.**

## ✅ Answer  
Unlike compiled languages, Python applications don’t go through a heavy compile step. However, building a Python app still involves packaging, dependency resolution, and distribution steps that are critical for CI/CD and production deployment.
The Python build process includes:

1. Organizing the project structure  
2. Managing dependencies  
3. Compiling to bytecode (optional)  
4. Creating distributable artifacts (wheel/sdist)  
5. Publishing the package (optional)

---

### 🧭 Detailed Python Build Process

#### 1. 🗂️ **Organize the Project Structure**
A good Python project starts with this structure:
```
myapp/
│
├── myapp/              # Application source code
│   └── __init__.py
├── tests/              # Unit tests
├── pyproject.toml      # Modern metadata and build system
├── requirements.txt    # Dependency list (optional)
└── README.md
```

---

#### 2. 📦 **Declare Dependencies**
- Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to declare dependencies.
- These are installed using `pip install`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### 3. 🛠️ **Build the Package**
Python uses tools like `setuptools` and `build` to package apps.

✅ Steps:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install build
python -m build
```

📦 This generates:
- `dist/myapp-0.1.0.tar.gz` (source distribution)
- `dist/myapp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel binary)

---

#### 4. 🧪 **Run Unit Tests**
Use `pytest`, `unittest`, or another test framework to ensure code quality:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

#### 5. 🚀 **Distribute or Deploy**
- **Distribute via PyPI (optional):**
```bash
pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
```

- **Deploy manually or via CI/CD:**  
Package can be deployed into containers, virtual machines, or directly to PaaS like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, etc.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

For a Flask-based API project:
- We declared dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Created a `pyproject.toml` for packaging metadata
- Ran `python -m build` in CI to produce a wheel
- Built a Docker image with the wheel inside
- Deployed it to Kubernetes using Helm

---

> Summary:  
> The Python build process involves organizing code, managing dependencies, building wheels/sdists, and optionally publishing to PyPI or packaging into Docker images. Even though Python is interpreted, structured builds help automate testing and deployment at scale.

---

### **72. Using Static Code Analysis, what kind of problems can you identify?**

## ✅ Answer  
Static code analysis helps detect issues in the source code **without executing it**. It's an early gate in the CI/CD pipeline to catch bugs, code smells, and violations of coding standards.

Static code analysis tools can identify a wide range of issues, including:

---

### 🔍 Types of Problems Identified by Static Analysis

#### 1. 🧠 **Syntax Errors and Language Misuse**
- Invalid syntax or misuse of language constructs.
- Missing imports, undeclared variables, etc.
```python
def test():
    print(x)   # x not defined
```

#### 2. 📏 **Coding Standard Violations**
- Violations of PEP8 in Python, PSR-12 in PHP, or Google's Java Style Guide.
- Examples:
  - Too long lines
  - Improper indentation
  - Poor variable naming

Tools: `pylint`, `flake8`, `checkstyle`, `eslint`

---

#### 3. 🔁 **Code Complexity and Maintainability**
- Detects overly complex functions or nested logic.
- Warns about:
  - Deep nesting
  - Too many return points
  - Long methods or files

### **73. Using Static Code Analysis, what kind of problems can you identify?**

## ✅ Answer  
Static code analysis helps detect issues in the source code **without executing it**. It's an early gate in the CI/CD pipeline to catch bugs, code smells, and violations of coding standards.
Static code analysis tools can identify a wide range of issues, including:

---

### 🔍 Types of Problems Identified by Static Analysis

#### 1. 🧠 **Syntax Errors and Language Misuse**
- Invalid syntax or misuse of language constructs.
- Missing imports, undeclared variables, etc.
```python
def test():
    print(x)   # x not defined
```

#### 2. 📏 **Coding Standard Violations**
- Violations of PEP8 in Python, PSR-12 in PHP, or Google's Java Style Guide.
- Examples:
  - Too long lines
  - Improper indentation
  - Poor variable naming

Tools: `pylint`, `flake8`, `checkstyle`, `eslint`

---

#### 3. 🔁 **Code Complexity and Maintainability**
- Detects overly complex functions or nested logic.
- Warns about:
  - Deep nesting
  - Too many return points
  - Long methods or files

Tool: `radon`, `sonarqube`, `jshint`

---

#### 4. 🔐 **Security Vulnerabilities**
- Identifies hardcoded credentials, SQL injection risks, unsanitized inputs.
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_input  # SQL Injection
```

Tools: `bandit` (Python), `Brakeman` (Ruby), `semgrep`

---

#### 5. 🧼 **Dead Code and Unused Variables**
- Finds unused imports, unreachable code, and variables that are never referenced.
```python
import json  # unused
```

---

#### 6. 🧪 **Incorrect Type Usage**
- Type mismatches or violations in statically typed languages.
- Tools like `mypy` for Python can even help with dynamic type checking.

---

#### 7. 🧯 **Common Bugs and Anti-Patterns**
- Examples:
  - Using `==` instead of `===` in JavaScript
  - Assigning instead of comparing (`=` vs `==`)
  - Resource leaks (e.g., open file not closed)

### **74. Static Code Analysis Slows Down CI Pipeline — How Will You Fix It?**

## ✅ Answer  
When static code analysis becomes a bottleneck in the CI pipeline, the key is to **optimize its execution** by limiting scope, parallelizing checks, or moving analysis to asynchronous or pre-merge steps.

If static analysis is slowing down the pipeline, I take the following steps to improve performance **without sacrificing code quality**.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Optimization Strategy

#### 1. 🔄 **Run Analysis Only on Changed Files**
Instead of scanning the whole codebase, restrict analysis to recently modified files:
```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep '\.py$' | xargs pylint
```

> ✅ Benefit: Cuts analysis time drastically, especially in large monorepos.

---

#### 2. 🧵 **Run Analysis in Parallel**
Use tools or flags that support multi-threaded/static checks:
```bash
flake8 --jobs=4
eslint . --max-warnings=0 --parallel
```

Or split checks across CI matrix jobs in GitHub Actions:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    part: [backend, frontend]
```

---

#### 3. 🕒 **Shift Left: Run Analysis Pre-CI**
Enforce basic static checks via pre-commit hooks so developers catch issues before pushing:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

✅ Tools: `pre-commit`, `husky`, `lint-staged`

---

#### 4. 🧪 **Run Heavy Checks on a Schedule**
- Keep quick linting in PR builds.
- Offload deeper security scans (e.g., `bandit`, `semgrep`) to scheduled workflows (daily or nightly).

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Runs at 2 AM UTC
```

---

#### 5. 🎯 **Tune Rules and Severity**
- Avoid enabling all rules by default.
- Focus on **high-impact rules** (security, correctness) in CI.
- Move **style-based** checks to a lower-priority job or local checks.

---

#### 6. 📦 **Cache Tool Dependencies**
- Caching virtualenvs, node_modules, or pip wheels prevents repeated installations:
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
```

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

In one repo, `pylint` checks across the monorepo were taking 4–5 minutes per build.

✅ Fixes applied:
- Limited to `git diff` changes
- Split frontend/backend linters into separate jobs
- Added pre-commit hooks for basic checks

**Result:** Pipeline time reduced by ~70% without removing static checks.

---

> Summary:  
> When static analysis slows down the pipeline:
> - Run checks only on changed files  
> - Use parallel jobs  
> - Offload heavy scans to scheduled builds  
> - Use pre-commit hooks to shift checks earlier  
> - Tune rule sets and cache dependencies

### **75. App in ‘OutOfSync’ State in Argo CD, But No Git Changes — What Could Be the Reason?**

## ✅ Answer  
In Argo CD, an application may show as **OutOfSync** even when Git hasn't changed, because the **live Kubernetes state differs from the desired Git state**.

This typically happens when **someone manually modified resources** in the cluster, or when **non-Git-managed changes** occur (e.g., automatic scaling or label updates).

---

### 🧭 Common Reasons and How to Fix Them

#### 1. 👨‍🔧 **Manual Changes in the Cluster**
Someone edited a deployment, config map, or secret directly using `kubectl edit`, `kubectl patch`, or via another tool (like Helm or the Kubernetes Dashboard).

✅ Fix:  
Revert manual changes by syncing the app via Argo CD:
```bash
argocd app sync <app-name>
```

---

#### 2. 🔄 **Dynamic Changes Not Tracked in Git**
Some fields (like annotations, replica counts via HPA) may change at runtime and cause drift.

✅ Options:
- Use `ignoreDifferences` in `Application` manifest to exclude these fields:
```yaml
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
```

---

#### 3. 🪵 **Secrets Automatically Rotated**
If you're using tools like **Sealed Secrets**, **External Secrets**, or **Vault Agent Injector**, secrets might rotate or mutate at runtime.

✅ Fix:  
- Use `ignoreDifferences` for secret fields
- Or exclude secrets from Argo CD sync tracking

---

#### 4. ⏱️ **Argo CD Sync Window Missed**
If auto-sync is enabled but sync windows (time-based restrictions) are defined, changes might not be applied even if detected.

✅ Fix:
- Check for sync windows in Argo CD settings or annotations
- Trigger manual sync if needed

---

#### 5. 🔀 **CRDs or Hooks Trigger Drift**
If a Helm release contains post-install hooks or CRDs that modify resources post-sync, drift may be detected.

✅ Fix:
- Ensure generated resources are tracked properly
- Use Helm’s `skipHooks: true` if safe to ignore

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

We had an application stuck in `OutOfSync` even though there were no Git changes.  
Root cause: A DevOps engineer had manually increased replica count on the Deployment to test scaling.

✅ Resolution:
- Re-synced the app from Argo CD to restore Git-desired state.
- Added `ignoreDifferences` to skip replica count drift in future.

---

> Summary:  
> Argo CD marks an app `OutOfSync` when the live state in the cluster doesn’t match Git — not just when Git changes.

### **77. When a build fails in Jenkins, how will you send an email?**

### 📝 Short Explanation  
To notify stakeholders or developers about failed builds, Jenkins can send automated emails using the **Email Notification** or **Editable Email Notification** plugin.

## ✅ Answer  

When a Jenkins build fails, I configure it to **automatically send email alerts** using either the **built-in Email Notification** system or the **Email Extension Plugin** for more control.

---

### 🧭 Steps to Configure Email Notifications on Build Failure

#### 1. 🧩 **Install Email Extension Plugin**
- Go to **Manage Jenkins → Plugin Manager → Available**
- Search and install: `Email Extension Plugin`

---

#### 2. ⚙️ **Global Configuration**
Navigate to **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**  
- Set SMTP details:
  - SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
  - Use SSL/TLS
  - Port (typically 465 or 587)
  - Jenkins Email address (default sender)
- Set up authentication (username/password or app token)

✅ Example (for Gmail):
```text
SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
Use SSL: true
Port: 465
```

---

#### 3. 📤 **Configure Project to Send Emails**
In your Jenkins pipeline job or freestyle job:

- Scroll to **Post-build Actions**
- Add **Editable Email Notification**
  - **Project Recipient List:** e.g., `dev-team@example.com`
  - **Triggers:** Select **Failure - Send email on build failure**

✅ Optional Email Content:
- Subject: `$PROJECT_NAME - Build #$BUILD_NUMBER - FAILED!`
- Body:
```groovy
Build failed at $BUILD_URL
Triggered by: $CAUSE
```

---

#### 4. 🧪 **Testing**
Trigger a dummy failure and confirm that email notifications are received.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example

In our Jenkins setup:
- We used the **Email Extension Plugin**
- Configured triggers for `FAILURE`, `UNSTABLE`, and `FIXED`
- Used custom HTML templates to include links to logs and commit diffs
- For pull requests, we added author-specific alerts using `git commit --author`

---

> Summary:  
> To notify on build failure:
> - Install and configure the Email Extension Plugin  
> - Set SMTP details under Jenkins global settings  
> - Enable email triggers in your job configuration  
> - Customize recipient list and email templates for clarity
