# Elite SRE / DevOps / Platform Engineer Journey

**Goal:** Crack ₹1 Cr+ compensation roles in India by becoming an elite engineer, not just a tool user.

```₹1 Cr SRE/Devops/Platform roles are not about knowing tools — they are about thinking clearly under complexity and explaining tradeoffs with confidence.```

This repo tracks my end-to-end preparation across:
- Data Structures & Algorithms (LeetCode-first)
- Coding for DevOps/SRE
- Linux, Networking, NAT, Debugging
- Kubernetes internals
- AWS & Cloud design
- System design & reliability
- Principal-level interview narratives

### Why LeetCode first?
Most DevOps/SRE candidates fail not due to tools,
but due to weak problem-solving and coding fundamentals.

I’m fixing that first.

## Most people:

- Collect notes ❌
- Memorize tools ❌
- Panic in interviews ❌

## This repo forces you to:

- Think
- Design
- Code/Implement
- Explain
- Document decisions
- Build principal-level narratives

This is a **long-term commitment**, not a shortcut.
